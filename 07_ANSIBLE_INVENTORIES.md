# Working with ansible inventories

How to use ansible when you have different VMs and different roles for each VM?
This is where `inventories` come in.

Inventories let you define the various `hosts` and `groups` them logically.
You can then use selector `patterns` to select hosts and groups for specific ansible runs.

In the previous chapter, we did not use an inventory file.
This is because Vagrant generates a default inventory file that is good enough for most trivial cases.

However, for more complex use cases, it is advisable to specify the inventory file ourselves.

It is still possible to use the Vagrant API to specify the inventory, but we would like to reuse the ansible code for VMs that are not provisioned by Vagrant, so let us separate the concerns of spinning up the VMs (vagrant) and configuring the VMs. (ansible)


## Using a basic local inventory file.

Let us bring up two VMs using Vagrant using a JSON configuration file.


Create the following `cluster.json` file

```
{
    "nodes": [
        {
            "host_name": "web-01",
            "port_mappings": [
                { "guest_port": 80, "host_port": 8083, "host_ip": "127.0.0.1" },
                { "guest_port": 22, "host_port": 22003, "host_ip": "127.0.0.1" }
            ],
            "network_configs": [
                { "ip": "192.167.32.3", "name": "vboxnet0", "adapter": 2 }
            ]
        },
        {
            "host_name": "db-01",
            "port_mappings": [
                { "guest_port": 80, "host_port": 8084, "host_ip": "127.0.0.1" },
                { "guest_port": 22, "host_port": 22004, "host_ip": "127.0.0.1" }
            ],
            "network_configs": [
                { "ip": "192.167.32.4", "name": "vboxnet0", "adapter": 2 }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Use the following `Vagrantfile`

```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

nodes_config = (JSON.parse(File.read("cluster.json")))['nodes']

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  nodes_config.each do |node|

    config.vm.define node["host_name"] do |vm_config|

      vm_config.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
      vm_config.vm.hostname = node["host_name"]

      vm_config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.memory = 512
        vb.cpus = 1
      end

      port_mappings = node["port_mappings"]

      port_mappings.each do |port_mapping|
        vm_config.vm.network "forwarded_port", 
          guest: port_mapping["guest_port"], 
          host: port_mapping["host_port"], 
          host_ip: port_mapping["host_ip"]
      end

      network_configs = node["network_configs"]

      network_configs.each do |network_config|
        vm_config.vm.network "private_network", 
            ip: network_config['ip'], 
            name: network_config['name'], 
            adapter: network_config['adapter']
      end
    end
  end

  config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "playbook.yaml"
    ansible.inventory_path = "inventory.yaml"
  end
  
end


```

Here, we are spinning up a 2 cluster VM by reading the configuration file. 
We are using the ansible provisioner and using a playbook called `playbook.yaml` to configure the VMs.
We have also specified an additional file valled `inventory.yaml` where we specify the VM inventory to the ansible provisioner.


Create the required files using the following command:

```
mkdir db web db/tasks web/tasks
touch playbook.yaml inventory.yaml db/tasks/main.yaml web/tasks/main.yaml
```


Modify the `inventory.yaml` to contain the following contents.

```
---

all:
  children:
    webservers:
      hosts:
        web-01:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
          ansible_port: 22003 
          ansible_private_key_file: .vagrant/machines/web-01/virtualbox/private_key
    dbservers:
      hosts:
        db-01:
          ansible_host: 127.0.0.1
          ansible_port: 22004 
          ansible_private_key_file: .vagrant/machines/db-01/virtualbox/private_key
```

Let us inspect the contents of the `inventory.yaml` in a bit more detail

Here in the inventory, we have specified 2 `groups` called `webservers` and `dbservers`.
In the `playbook.yaml` we will use these group names to associate roles with them.

The `webservers` group contains one VM called `web-01` and the `dbservers` group contains one VM called `db-01`.


Also, note that we have specified the host names and the port names and the private key file to connect to the ansible VM. And, the ansible ports are the same ports that we have mapped to port 22 in the respective guest VMs in the `cluster.json`. This is because are using a custom inventory file and not using the default inventory generated by Vagrant. Hence, the information is duplicated.


Modify the `playbook.yaml` file to contain the following contents.

```
---

- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - web
  become: true


- name: Configure db servers
  hosts: dbservers
  roles:
    - db
  become: true
```

Modify the `db/tasks/main.yaml` to contain the following contents.

```
---

- name: Install postgres
  apt:
    name:
      - postgresql
      - postgresql-contrib
    state: present
    update_cache: true

```


Modify the `web/tasks/main.yaml` to contain the following contents:

```
---

- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: true
```

Now, run `vagrant up`. You should see the VMs getting provisioned, with each VM getting configured as per the respective roles.
