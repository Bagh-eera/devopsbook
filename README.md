# Introduction

I am writing this book to document my learnings as a DevOps engineer over the years.

You are welcome to use it by the way :)

If someone were to ask me to teach them about "devOps" or "Infrastructure as Code", this is what I would give them. This is by no means the one true way of learning DevOps. Also the tools I use and choices I make are mostly personal preferences. 

Most of this is hands on examples, but I will to drop some theory and best practices here and there.

Try to work through the examples here instead of reading this like a book.

You can start looking at the table of Contents [here](SUMMARY.md).
